### Insertion Comparison

The `compare_insertion()` function compares the performance of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a Linked List in terms of insertion time. It tracks the time taken to insert 5000 random values into both data structures and plots the results.

### Files Structure

- **`main.py`**: Contains the `compare_insertion()` function and is the main script to run the comparison.
- **`LinkedList.py`**: Contains the implementation of the Linked List class.
- **`BinarySearchTree.py`**: Contains the implementation of the Binary Search Tree class.

### Requirements

- Python 3.9
- `matplotlib` library
- `random` and `time` (standard Python libraries)

### Running the File

1. Install the required dependencies (if necessary):
```
pip install matplotlib
```
2. To run the file, simply execute the `main.py` script:
```
python main.py
```
